# H-hat Dialects

Dialects are independent programming languages that share some common features, as defined by [H-hat rule system](../rule_system.md). Although they may be syntactically different, their essence in those rules must be the same.

To enable experiencing what H-hat proposes, a first H-hat dialect was created, called [Heather](heather/index.md).
